A few simple plugins that extend standard functionality to help overcome problems that shouldn’t exist!


// KeyboardHelper
Ensures that the keyboard does not hide the current field with focus. Does this by shifting the view up and down. Requires the field to be auto aligned. Simply add in the helper and then make the 2 function calls in ViewDidLoad and you’re set!

Also registers for tapping so keyboard hides when tapping somewhere else.
